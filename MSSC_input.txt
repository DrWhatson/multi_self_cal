# Input file for Multi-Source Self-Calibration (MSSC)

# Need to have AIPS & Python & Parseltongue installed
# A CASA version is in development
############### USAGE ###################
# You need a split & averaged file for each source. The averaging should be enough so that the visibilties correspond to just that source.
# If your observation is done in multiple phase centre observing then this should be ok!
# The UV data sets used in calibration needs to be in the same directory as this file and multi_source_self_cal.py
# Check your inputs and then use the command below
# The command is: ParselTongue multi_source_self_cal.py MSSC_input.txt
